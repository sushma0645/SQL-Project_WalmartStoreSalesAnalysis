# About

This project explores the Walmart Sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products, and customer behavior. The aim is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The dataset was obtained from the [the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.[source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecastin)
