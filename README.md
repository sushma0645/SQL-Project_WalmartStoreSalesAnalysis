# Walmart Store Sales Data Analysis

## About

This project explores the Walmart Store Sales data to understand top-performing branches and products, sales trends of different products, and customer behavior. The aim is to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized. The dataset was obtained from the [the Kaggle Walmart Store Sales Forecasting Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.[source](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecastin)

## Project Objective

This project aims to obtain insight into Walmart's sales data to comprehend the various elements that influence sales at various locations.

## About Data

The dataset was obtained from the [the Kaggle Walmart Store Sales Forecasting Competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting) This dataset contains sales transactions from three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows.

## Analysis 

1. Product Analysis

> Analyze the data to identify the various product lines, the best-performing ones, and the ones that require improvement.

2. Sales Analysis

> The purpose of this analysis is to respond to the query on the product's sales trends. The outcome of this can be used to gauge how well each sales approach the company uses and what adjustments are necessary to increase sales.

3. Customer Analysis

> The purpose of this analysis is to identify the various customer segments, purchase patterns, and profitability of each segment.

## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling:** In this initial step, data is inspected to ensure that **NULL** and missing values are found, and data replacement techniques are applied to replace the missing or **NULL** values.

> 1. Build a database
> 2. Create the table and insert the data.
> 3. Select the columns where the values are null. We screened out null values when we created the tables, so there are no null entries in our database. Instead, each field is set to **NOT NULL**.

2. **Feature Engineering:** This will enable us to create some new columns out of the ones that already exist.

> 1. To provide insight into sales in the morning, afternoon, and evening, add a new column called `time_of_day`. This will assist in addressing the query of what time of day most sales occur.

> 2. To record the extracted days of the week on which the provided transaction occurred, add a new column called `day_name` (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will assist in addressing the query of which day of the week each branch is busiest.

> 3. Create a new column called `month_name` with the extracted months (Jan, Feb, Mar) of the year that the given transaction occurred. Assist in identifying the month with the most profit and sales for the year.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of the project.

## Revenue And Profit Calculations

$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

$VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

**Gross Margin** is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

<u>**Example with the first row in our DB:**</u>

**Data given:**

- $ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
- $ \text{Quantity} = 7 $

$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5\% * COGS\\= 5\%  320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = $336.5565$

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\\approx 4.7619\% $
